    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is an AI Payment Assistant?</h2>
      <p>
        An AI payment assistant is a software layer – often in your banking app or a separate budgeting app –
        that analyses transactions and card data to give you easier-to-read summaries and suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of scrolling through raw statements, you might see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic categorisation of purchases (groceries, travel, subscriptions, etc.).</li>
        <li>Forecasts of when your statement and minimum payments are due.</li>
        <li>Highlights of unusual activity or big upcoming charges.</li>
        <li>Explanations of fees or interest in more human language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The assistant does not replace your bank or card agreement; it sits on top of existing systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What AI assistants do -->
    <section id="use-cases" class="section">
      <h2>Common Use-Cases for AI Around Card Payments</h2>
      <p>Typical functions you’ll see marketed as “AI” in payment assistants include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart alerts:</strong> reminders before due dates, nudges when spending spikes, or alerts when
          a subscription renews at a higher price.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spending insights:</strong> monthly breakdowns, visual trends and simple explanations of where
          your money went.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scenario questions:</strong> chat-style interfaces where you can ask “How much did I spend on travel last month?” or “What happens if I only pay the minimum?”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subscription control:</strong> detecting recurring charges and helping you identify things you
          may want to cancel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-card overview:</strong> seeing balances, due dates and key terms across several cards in
          one place, depending on data access and permissions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools are most helpful when they make existing information more understandable – not when they try
        to guess what you “should” do with debt.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits & risks -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Privacy and Things to Watch Out For</h2>
      <p>AI assistants can be useful, but there are important limits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a decision-maker:</strong> they usually cannot change your credit limit, due date or terms.
          Those are still controlled by your card issuer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data access & privacy:</strong> to work properly, assistants may need access to detailed
          transaction data. It matters how this data is stored, shared and secured.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Possible errors:</strong> categorisation and predictions can be wrong. You should not rely on them
          as your only record of spending or obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No personalised financial advice:</strong> most tools are designed for general information and
          cannot account for your full financial situation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always read how an AI assistant handles your data, and treat its summaries as a complement to, not a
        replacement for, your official card statements.
